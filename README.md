Solidity Homework


This assignment provides the opportunity for the student-author (me, Franklin Bueno) with a chance to compose and execute smart contracts in the solidity software IDE, solidity remix. There are three different contracts. The first contract is for the equal distrivution of funds. The sceond contract is for the weighted distrubtion of funds. The third contract is for the retirement plan.

At least for the first two exercises, the student-author was able to compile and execute the ethereum remix smart contract. The execution was recorded on ganache. At this point, the student-author is attempting to reproduce on the Kovan network.
