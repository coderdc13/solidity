Solidity Homework


This assignment provides the opportunity for the student-author (me, Franklin Bueno) with a chance to compose and execute smart contracts in the solidity software IDE, solidity remix. There are three different contracts. The first contract is for the equal distrivution of funds. The sceond contract is for the weighted distrubtion of funds. The third contract is for the retirement plan.

At least for the first two exercises, the student-author was able to compile and execute the ethereum remix smart contract. The execution was recorded on ganache. At this point, the student-author is attempting to reproduce on the Kovan network.

In terms of the screenshots of the actions and processes above, the actions and processes share a pattern. There is the establishment of the ganache test blockchain account, the compilation of the smart contract, the deployment of the smart contract, the exchange of ether/wei as conducted by metamask, and the verification in the ganache transaction ledger. All of these processes were recorded successfully.

In terms of the screenshots of the actions and processes above, the actions and processes share a pattern. There is the establishment of the kovan blockchain account, the compilation of the smart contract, the deployment of the smart contract, the exchange of ether/wei as conducted by metamask, and the verification in etherscan. Furthermore, the final transactions from the accounts were recorded on the MyCrypto application. All of these processes were recorded successfully. The false starts were also recorded.
